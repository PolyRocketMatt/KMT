# Kotlin Mathematical Toolkit

KMT is a library for various mathematical operations in Kotlin. Its original purpose was to provide
a modular library for mathematical tasks. 

## Modules

KMT is split into several modules, each of which can be used independently. Currently, the following modules
are available:

* `common` - Common mathematical operations
* `vector` - Vector classes and operations 
* `interval` - Interval classes and operations
* `functions` - Functions and their relative operations (algebraic operations, integration, differentiation)
