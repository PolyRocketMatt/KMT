KMT is a library for various mathematical operations in Kotlin. Its original purpose was to provide
a modular library for mathematical tasks. While libraries such as KMath already exist, KMT provides
a more user-friendly experience by providing a more modular approach to mathematical operations whilst
also being very intuitive to use.

## Modules

KMT is split into several modules, each of which can be used independently. Currently, the following modules
are available:

* [`common`](https://github.com/PolyRocketMatt/KMT/wiki/KMT-Common) - Common mathematical operations
* [`interval`](https://github.com/PolyRocketMatt/KMT/wiki/KMT-Interval) - Interval classes and operations
* [`vector`](https://github.com/PolyRocketMatt/KMT/wiki/KMT-Vector) - Vector classes and operations
* [`trigonometry`](https://github.com/PolyRocketMatt/KMT/wiki/KMT-Trigonometry) - Tabular trigonometric functions for faster computation
* [`function`](https://github.com/PolyRocketMatt/KMT/wiki/KMT-Function) - Functions and their relative operations (algebraic operations, integration, differentiation)
* [`matrix`](https://github.com/PolyRocketMatt/KMT/wiki/KMT-Matrix) - Matrix classes and operations
