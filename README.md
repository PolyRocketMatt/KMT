KMT is a library for various mathematical operations in Kotlin. Its original purpose was to provide
a modular library for mathematical tasks. While libraries such as KMath already exist, KMT provides
a more user-friendly experience by providing a more modular approach to mathematical operations whilst
also being very intuitive to use.

## Modules

KMT is split into several modules, each of which can be used independently. Currently, the following modules
are available:

* `common` - Common mathematical operations
* `interval` - Interval classes and operations
* `vector` - Vector classes and operations
* `trigonometry` - Tabular trigonometric functions for faster computation
* `functions` - Functions and their relative operations (algebraic operations, integration, differentiation)
