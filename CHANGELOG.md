### 0.0.9 

- Make all modules separately available
- No major changes

---

### 0.0.8 - Matrix Update
 
- Matrices are now supported.

- Certain operations like row-echelon form (ref) and gauss jordan (rref) elimination are now supported for matrices
- Linear Algebra operations (eigenvalues, eigenvectors, etc. for matrices) 
- Linear Algebra concepts (vector spaces, etc.)
- Some utilities were added to support matrices

**PLANNED**

- Expressions 
- Autodiff (numerical/symbolic differentiation already supported)
- Further linear algebra concept and operation implementations
